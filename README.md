Code -> copy the github URL -> copy the folder path required -> go to the cmd prompt -> go to the folder path -> git clone github URL -> check the folder -> copy the ipynb and pkl files into this folder inorder to commit the changes

create a new environment

```conda remove -p bhpvenv --all```

```conda activate bhpvenv\```

then create requirements.txt file to install the libraries required for the project

then in terminal -> pip install -r requirements.txt

then configure the git cli using
```git config --global user.name "Dhivya N"(the item inside quotes to configure for the first time only)```
```git config --global user.email "dhivya.n@latentview.com"```

gitignore contains path which we dont want to commit to main branch
Inorder to not commit the changes to the branch, include that path in gitignore

git add filename -> will add the file to be committed -> stages the files
git add . -> to add all the files that has been changed 

git status -> will show the files to be committed
git commit -m "commit message"-> will stage all the files and commit the changes
